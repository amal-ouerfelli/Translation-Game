## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)

### Clone the repository
```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amal-ouerfelli/Translation-Game.git
```
### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the server directory:
    ```bash
   cd backend
    ```
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
   npm i
    ```

### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the client directory:
    ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
   npm i
   ```

## Starting the application

1. Ensure that the backend server is running:
    ```bash
   cd backend
   npm run dev
   ```
The server will run on http://localhost:7000

2. In a separate terminal, start the frontend:
    ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
       ```

The client will run on http://localhost:3000

3. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

## Technical Choices

### Backend

1. Express: A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

2. Socket.io: Enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication. It was used to manage real-time updates for player connections and turns.

3. Mongoose: An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a straightforward, schema-based solution to model application data.


### Frontend
1. React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components.

2. Socket.io-client: The client-side library for Socket.io, enabling real-time communication with the server.

### Why these choices?

1. Ease of Development: Using Express, React, and Socket.io together simplifies the development of real-time applications.

2. Scalability: This stack is scalable and suitable for building real-time applications with interactive user interfaces.

3. Community and Support: All chosen technologies have large communities and good documentation, which helps in finding solutions to any issues quickly.

## Improvements

### Current limitations

1. Scalability: As the number of players grows, the server might face performance issues.

2. Error Handling: Improved error handling and validation are needed both on the server and client sides.

3. Game Logic: Currently, the game logic is simplistic. More complex rules and features can be added.

### Suggested Improvements
1. Unit Tests: Add unit tests to ensure the reliability of both backend and frontend code.

2. UI/UX Enhancements: Improve the user interface and experience with better design and usability features.

3. Security: Implement authentication and authorization to secure player data and game sessions.

## Development Time
It took approximately 25 hours to build this application. The time was spent on the following tasks:

1. Backend Development: 6 hours
2. Frontend Development: 11 hours
3. Testing and Debugging: 5 hours
4. Documentation: 3 hours

## Some screenshots & explanations

It's about a race between two players, that's why two players should connect from two differents browsers.

 This is the first screen when the player should input his username to start the game:

When connecting, we have this screen displaying total points and list of connected players...
The player who connect first will start playing

The other player should wait his turn that's why the input zone is disabled and the play button is not clickable:

Total points updates in real time as well as total of good and wrong answers:

When the player click on the total points, the answers history is displayed:

When one player's score reached 0 or 20, the game will end and a modal displaying the winner is displayed.

When a user navigate to a page different to http://localhost:3000, a page 404 not found is displayed:
